Description: The package constructs and predicts the general P-splines of Li and Cao (2022)
    <arXiv:2201.06808> in mgcv by defining a new 'gps' smooth class
    (see ?gps.smooth). A general P-spline f(x) is specified as s(x, bs = 'gps', ...) in a formula
    and estimated using mgcv's model fitting functions, namely gam (generalized additive
    models, or GAMs), bam (GAMs for big data) and gamm (GAMs as mixed-effect models).
    General P-splines are state-of-the-art penalized B-splines. Unlike the standard P-splines of
    Eilers and Marx (1996) <doi:10.1214/ss/1038425655> that only make sense for uniform
    B-splines on equidistant knots, they are properly defined for non-uniform B-splines on
    irregularly spaced knots, thanks to their powerful general difference penalty that accounts
    for uneven knot spacing. The package also contains functions for fitting and benchmarking
    different penalized B-splines (see ?Fit4BS and ?SimStudy) and a case study of smoothing
    Bone Mineral Content longitudinal data (see ?BMC).
